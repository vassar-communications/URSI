        <p><em>C. elegans</em> is a soil-dwelling nematode that serves as an important model organism in the biological sciences. Recently, scientists have discovered that <em>C. elegans</em> can detect light, despite lacking eyes. Our aim was to confirm the reaction of<em>&#38;nbsp;C. elegans</em> in response to blue wavelengths of light. Because our past research has shown that <em>C. elegans</em> do not react to red light, we used this as our control. We placed individual nematodes in water-filled cuvettes, and measured their swimming behavior using laser diffraction and a photodiode. As nematodes move, the diffraction pattern changes, and we can calculate their swimming rate based on our measurements of this diffraction pattern. We found that <em>C. elegans</em> move an average of ~0.3 Hz faster in blue (447 nm) light as compared to red (633 nm) light. This indicates that <em>C. elegans</em> do detect blue light, and swim faster to avoid shorter wavelengths of light. We also looked at the effects of changes in light intensity on <em>C. elegans</em> swimming, but we did not find a statistically significant difference in swimming rates for blue light. Future studies will include examining <em>C. elegans&#8217;</em>&#38;nbsp;responses to other wavelengths of light, including both intermediate wavelengths between the two we studied and even shorter wavelengths in the ultraviolet range.</p>
